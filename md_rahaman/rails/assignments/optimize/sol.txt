1. Retrieve all players, then write a program that will loop through each player and display their team name, mascot and stadium. How many queries have we done?

	players = Player.all
	players.each do |player|
		player.team.name
	end
2. players = Player.includes(:team).limit(10)
3.  players = Player.includes(:team).where("teams.name ='Chicago Bulls'").references(:team)
	Team.where(name: "Chicago Bulls").includes(:players)[0].players

4. Player.includes(:team).where("teams.stadium = 'Staples Center'").references(:team)

5. Team.joins(:players).where("players.name LIKE 'Z%'")


 Player.where("name LIKE 'Z%'")
